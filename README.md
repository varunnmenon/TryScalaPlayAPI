# TryScalaPlayAPI
Created a scala API using the startup project.

You can download the example startup project from https://github.com/playframework/play-samples/tree/2.7.x/play-scala-rest-api-example

The app was built using IntelliJ IDEA IDE by enabling the Scala plugin. Plugin can be downloded by Navigating to "Preferences -> Plugin -> Scala Plugin" in IntelliJ

To open the project, click on File -> Open , navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the project, click on build.sbt file and then click Open as Project and then click on Ok.

After the project is opened, you have to click on "Add Configuration". When the project is indexing, the Add Configuration is disabled by the IDE. If you face the same issue, please wait for the indexing to finish and then click on Add Configuration. 

Once the Add Configuration Screen is open, click on + sign on the top right and then select "sbt Task". Type run in "NAME:" and "TASK:" and then click on OK.

Now you are all set to run the project.
